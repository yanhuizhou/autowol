    <div><b>Name</b> - Arbitrary device identifier. Doesn't need to be the same as the name of the real device.</div>
    <div><b>Mac</b> - Mac address of the network card of the device to wake.</div>
    <div><b>Broadcast IP/FQDN</b> - Network broadcast IP (most commonly 192.168.0.255 and 192.168.1.255) or FQDN (fully qualified domain name - something like whatever.dyndns.com). This is an IP address or public FQDN used by your router to broadcast network packets.</div>
    <div><b>Port</b> - Port on which your device is listening for Wake-on-Lan packets (most commonly 9 and 7). Do not change unless you know what you're doing.</div>
    <div><b>Auto-Wake</b> - If enabled, AutoWOL will send WOL packets to the device as soon as your android device gets connected to the Wi-Fi.</div>
    <div><b>Wi-Fi SSID</b> - Wi-Fi network SSID is your wireless access point (router) name. WOL packets will be automatically sent to the device only when connected to this AP.</div>
    <div><b>Quiet hours</b> - Period during which automatic Wake-on-Lan will be suppressed. We don't want the app to turn the device on during the night on random Wi-Fi disconnects, do we? :)</div>
    <div><b>Idle time</b> - Period after last Wi-Fi disconnect during which automatic Wake-on-Lan will be suppresed. This can be used to suppress sending WOL packets during the day on random Wi-Fi disconnects (will not ignore Quiet hours restrictions).</div>
